Pico Bootstrap Theme (w/ Cerulean)
====================

First things first. This theme is very unoptimized in its current state. In fact, all I did was make a few minor edits.
The javascript isnt compressed and the assets folder is bloated. Use at your own risk. Also feel free to do whatever you want with the theme, provided
you adhere to all the licenses of Bootstrap, Bootswatch, and Pico.

I have to provide some credit to the dudes at Bootswatch for providing the Cerulean theme. Go check them out!! Also the dude who made Pico.
